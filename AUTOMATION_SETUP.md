# ðŸš€ Automated Deployment Setup Instructions

## Current Status
âœ… **Vercel Integration**: Your app auto-deploys on every push to main branch  
âœ… **Production URL**: https://explorer.mltutor.nl/  
âœ… **GitHub Actions**: Active and running (2 workflows deployed)
âœ… **Token Permissions**: Updated with workflow scope

## Completed Automation
Since your app is already connected to Vercel, **automated deployment is already working**:
- Push to GitHub â†’ Vercel automatically builds and deploys
- Live updates in 2-3 minutes
- Zero configuration needed

## GitHub Actions Setup (Optional)
For additional testing and preview deployments, complete these steps:

### 1. Update GitHub Token Permissions
Your current token lacks 'workflow' scope. Create a new token:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select these scopes:
   - âœ… `repo` (Full control of repositories)
   - âœ… `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
4. Copy the new token
5. Update your git credentials:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://NEW_TOKEN@github.com/stablum/ml-explorer.git
   ```

### 2. Add Workflow Files
```bash
# Restore workflow files
mv .github/workflows_backup .github/workflows
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Configure Vercel Secrets (Optional)
For GitHub Actions integration:
1. Get Vercel token: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Add these secrets in GitHub: https://github.com/stablum/ml-explorer/settings/secrets/actions
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `ORG_ID` 
   - `PROJECT_ID`

## Current Workflow
âœ… **Simple & Working**: 
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
# âœ¨ Auto-deployed to https://explorer.mltutor.nl/
```
