I need an app to explore a 1D gaussian mixture, visualized as a probability chart.
The x in the chart is the domain of the values and the y in the chart is probability.
It should be able to take a dataset from a file.
Also, it should be able to run a maximization-expectation algorithm.
Should be able to traverse the various E and M iterations with buttons to go forward and backwards.
Should display all parameters all the time, also while they are being progressively refined.
Should show the mus as vertical lines.
Should plot the gaussian components.
Should show the gaussian mixture.
The main aim is for the student that is using this tool to see the interplay between parameter values and centers.
The user should be able to drag the center of a gaussian component around.
Also, the user should be able to drag a component down or up to reduce or increase its pi parameter.
There should be a mode that by hovering the chart a vertical line is displayed seamlessly, that line represent a query to the mixture. During this interaction the value of the probability of the mixture should be displayed, as well as the probability within the individual component; also, the posterior probability of the query point being of each of the components (so sum of those probabilities should obviously be 1).
The interface should be web, also deployable online on a service free of charge.
Also make a docker thing to run it locally.
